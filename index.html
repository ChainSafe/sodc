            <h1>Self Organized Development Cycles</h1>
            <aside>Inspired by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, the SODC principles attempt to create a set of principles for web3.0. Started during the Fellowship of Ethereum Magician's Council of Prague, this is a constantly evolving conversation that can be updated through PRs on github. Please join the conversation on the FEM <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ways-of-self-organization-in-decentralized-development-cycles/1713" target="_blank">discourse page</a>.</aside>

       <h3><strong>The Principles</strong></h3>

      <p>
    <li>The highest priority is communication followed by process.</li>
    <li>Sharing knowledge by never saying no, always empowering individuals to participate in discourse.</li>
    <li>Self organization looks and feels different to different people, defining process and methodology for organizations is vital for decentralized development cycles.</li>
    <li>SODC is about the people; user, developer, designer, etc… needs come first.</li>
    <li>Inclusiveness as a mechanism for realizing individuals and collectives perspectives transparently.</li>
    <li>DoAcracy as a method for creating self determined and self regulated development cycles. This allows for the individuals of an organization to take responsibility for their day to day tasks through a self determined process.</li>
    <li>Milestones are a crucial aspect of SODC, allowing for team accomplishments to be celebrated. Whether the milestone was completed or not, the aim is to allow for an empirical study of the current SODC process being implemented.</li>
    <li>A transparent and open process between all aspects of the development cycle is expected. Ensuring research, design, implementation, etc… are all working together and not against each other.</li>
    <li>For SODC to be effective, it is important to collaborate with the wider open source ecosystem. Separate teams working on similar, dependent or complementary works should collaborate and share knowledge for the benefit of the larger community and in turn as members of the community help themselves optimize their development cycles.</li>
    <li>In SODC teams operate by respect, not rank.</li>
